In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, an error might occur if you attempt to access the data before it has been fully retrieved. This often happens when using AsyncStorage.getItem asynchronously without proper error handling or without awaiting the result within an async function.

**Example of problematic code:**
```javascript
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then((value) => {
  // Use value here...  //This might cause an error if the value is not yet available
});

console.log(value); //Error: value is not defined, value is only available inside the .then block
```
